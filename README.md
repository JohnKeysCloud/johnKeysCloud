## Sup :) ‚úåüèΩ
I am a New York City native & multifaceted creative with tech proficiencies. I've developed an avant-garde taste in regard to the design aspect of technological experiences through my enjoyment of gaming, as I stream on Twitch. Experimenting with vanilla code & testing the balance of providing aesthetically gratifying interactivity while maintaining performance, accessibilty & SEO (where applicable) has become a favorite pastime. I strive to learn something new every day as to apply best practices in my work.
